* About
Oxidized rust re-implementation of [[https://github.com/HaoZeke/readCon][readCon]].

Reads and writes both =.con= (coordinate-only) and =.convel= (coordinates
plus velocities) simulation configuration files used by [[https://theory.cm.utexas.edu/eon/][eOn]].

** Features

- *CON and convel support:* Parses both coordinate-only and velocity-augmented files. Velocity sections are auto-detected without relying on file extensions.
- *Lazy iteration:* ~ConFrameIterator~ parses one frame at a time for memory-efficient trajectory processing.
- *Performance:* Uses [[https://github.com/aldanor/fast-float-rust][fast-float2]] (Eisel-Lemire algorithm) for the f64 parsing hot path and [[https://docs.rs/memmap2][memmap2]] for large trajectory files.
- *Parallel parsing:* Optional rayon-based parallel frame parsing behind the ~parallel~ feature gate.
- *Language bindings:* Python (PyO3), Julia (ccall), C (cbindgen FFI), and C++ (RAII header-only wrapper), following the hourglass design from [[https://github.com/metatensor/metatensor][Metatensor]].
- *RPC serving:* Optional Cap'n Proto RPC interface (~rpc~ feature) for network-accessible parsing.

** Quick start

#+begin_src shell
# Rust
cargo run --example rust_usage -- resources/test/tiny_cuh2.con

# Python
pip install readcon
python -c "import readcon; print(readcon.read_con('file.con'))"

# C/C++ (via meson subproject or cmake)
meson setup builddir -Dwith_examples=True && meson test -C builddir
#+end_src

** Design Decisions
The library is designed with the following principles in mind:

- *Lazy Parsing:* The ~ConFrameIterator~ allows for lazy parsing of frames, which can be more memory-efficient when dealing with large trajectory files.

- *Interoperability:* The FFI layer makes the core parsing logic accessible from other programming languages, increasing the library's utility. Currently, a ~C~ header is auto-generated along with a hand-crafted ~C++~ interface, following the hourglass design from [[https://github.com/metatensor/metatensor][Metatensor]].
*** FFI Layer
A key challenge in designing an FFI is deciding how data is exposed to the C-compatible world. This library uses a hybrid approach to offer both safety and convenience:

1.  *Opaque Pointers (The Handle Pattern):* The primary way to interact with
   frame data is through an opaque pointer, represented as ~RKRConFrame*~ in C.
   The C/C++ client holds this "handle" but cannot inspect its contents
   directly. Instead, it must call Rust functions to interact with the data
   (e.g., ~rkr_frame_get_header_line(frame_handle, ...~)). This is the safest
   and most flexible pattern, as it completely hides Rust's internal data
   structures and memory layout, preventing ABI breakage if the Rust code is
   updated.

2.  *Transparent ~#[repr(C)]~ Structs (The Data Extraction Pattern):* For
   convenience and performance in cases where only the core atomic data is
   needed, the library provides a function (~rkr_frame_to_c_frame~) to extract a
   "lossy" but transparent ~CFrame~ struct from an opaque handle. The C/C++
   client can directly read the fields of this struct (e.g.,
   ~my_c_frame->num_atoms~). The client takes ownership of this extracted struct
   and is responsible for freeing its memory.

This hybrid model provides the best of both worlds: the safety and
forward-compatibility of opaque handles for general use, and the performance of
direct data access for the most common computational tasks.

** Specification

See the [[https://lode-org.github.io/readcon-rs/spec.html][formal specification]] for full details. A summary follows.

*** CON format
- A 9-line header (comments, cell dimensions, cell angles, atom type/count/mass metadata)
- Per-type coordinate blocks (symbol, label, atom lines with x y z fixed atomID)
- Multiple frames are concatenated directly with no separator

*** convel format
Same as CON, with an additional velocity section after each frame's coordinates:
- A blank separator line
- Per-type velocity blocks (symbol, label, atom lines with vx vy vz fixed atomID)
